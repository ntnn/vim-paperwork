#vim-paperwork

[paperwork](https://github.com/twostairs/paperwork) is 'an open source note-taking and archiving tool'.  

vim-paperwork allows you to create, edit and delete notes from vim.  
Vim folds are used to display notebooks, thus default and personal keybindings can be used to navigate the sidebar.

To add notebooks and notes the desired title can be inserted.
In case of a mistake the title can be edited.
vim-paperwork automatically parses changes and pushes them to the remote host.
